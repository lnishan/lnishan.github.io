Hello! :)  
Welcome to my blog where I'll be sharing my experiences with internships over the next couple of months.

I'm a passionate and experienced student currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from National Chiao Tung University.  
You can find out more about me through my [Curriculum-Vitae](https://lnishan.github.io/Curriculum-Vitae/)! :)
